- The design have to be optimal
- The design should have as many abstraction as needed for achiving better readability
- The design should assume testing methods
- The internal structure should be described; the outer usage should be documented carefully
- Every external thing needed to perform syntesis of the design should be documented and described with detailed informations of origin
- Design should implement methods for performing runtime telemetry and debugging solutions if possible
