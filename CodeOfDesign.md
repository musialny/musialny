# The Code of Design

- The design have to be functional
- The design have to be optimal
- The design should have as many abstraction as needed for achieving better readability
- The design should assume testing and validation methods before it will be synthesized
- The internal structure should be described; the outer usage should be documented carefully
- Every external dependency needed to perform syntesis of the design should be documented and described with detailed informations of origin
- Design should implement methods for performing runtime telemetry and debugging solutions if possible
