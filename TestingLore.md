# The lore of the Tests

- Unit tests: The sm0l ones; tipically covers single functions, and sometimes, objects
- Fragment tests: Covers whole module (whatever it means); one level of complexity up in relation to Unit tests
- Integration tests: Tests that runs with software; sharing common execution context of whole process / aplication / system (etc.)
- E2E (End to End) tests: Covers testing end layer of software; for libraries it's their API, for applications is their (G)UI or communication protocol (f.e. REST API)
