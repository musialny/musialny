# The lore of the Tests

- Unit tests: The sm0l ones; tipically covers single units of design, f.e. design schematic or description or single function / procedure
- Fragment tests: Cover whole module (whatever it means); one level of complexity up in relation to Unit tests
- Integration tests: Tests that are embedded in a design
- E2E (End to End) tests: Cover testing end (usage) layer of design
