# The Flow of the Design

## Hardware

1. Specification
2. Logical Design (Schematics and / or HDLs)
3. Logical Design Simulation (Calculations)
4. Logical Design Tests (Unit, fragment, e2e)
5. Logical Design Testbench (integration tests, debug and telemetry)
6. Physical Design (Placement and Routing for physical substrate [PCB, IC or FPGA])
7. Physical Design Simulation (Calculations)
8. Physical Design Tests (Unit, fragment, e2e)
9. Physical Design Testbench (integration tests, debug and telemetry)
10. Final Validated Designs (telemetry keeped if necessary)

## Software

1. Specification
2. Implementation
3. Tests (Unit, fragment, e2e)
4. Test suite debug build (integration tests, debug and telemetry)
5. Final Validated Artefacts (telemetry keeped if necessary)
