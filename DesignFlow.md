# The Flow of the Design

## Hardware

1. Specification
2. Logical Design (Schematics and / or HDLs)
3. Logical Design Simulation (Calculations)
4. Logical Design Testbench (with integration tests, debug and telemetry)
5. Physical Design (Placement and Routing for physical substrate [PCB, IC or FPGA])
6. Physical Design Simulation (Calculations)
7. Physical Design Testbench (with integration tests, debug and telemetry)
8. Final Validated Designs (telemetry keeped if necessary)

## Software

1. Specification
2. Implementation
3. Test suite debug build (with integration tests, debug and telemetry)
4. Final Validated Artefacts (telemetry keeped if necessary)
