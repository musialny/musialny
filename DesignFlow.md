# The Flow of the Design

## Hardware

1. Specification
2. Logical Design (Schematics and / or HDLs)
3. Logical Design Simulation (Calculations)
4. Logical Design Tests (Unit, fragment)
5. Logical Design Testbench (Integration tests, e2e, debug and telemetry)
6. Physical Design (Placement and Routing for physical substrate [PCB, IC or FPGA])
7. Physical Design Simulation (Calculations)
8. Physical Design Tests (Unit, fragment, e2e)
9. Physical Design Testbench (Integration tests, e2e, debug and telemetry)
10. Final Validated Designs (Telemetry keeped if necessary)

## Software

1. Specification
2. Development Implementation
3. Development Implementation Tests (Unit, fragment)
4. Development Implementation Testbench (Integration tests, e2e, debug and telemetry)
5. Production Implementation
6. Production Implementation Testbench (Integration tests, e2e, debug and telemetry)
7. Final Validated Artefacts (Telemetry keeped if necessary)
